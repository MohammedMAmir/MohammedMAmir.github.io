### Hi, My Name's Mohammed:
Hi, my name is Mohammed Amir. I'm a software engineer, full-stack developer, problem solver,
and project management expert based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Have a look at my portfolio, 
the recent projects I've worked on, and feel free to get in touch.

## The Portfolio:
The website can be found at: https://mohammedmamir.github.io
The portfolio itself is loosely based off of Amelia Morgan's template along with my 
own personal spin of things I thought would be both fun, engaging, and challenging to add:
